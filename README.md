# Snake Game
A basic snake game I made in python. Includes the basic functionality of the classic snake game such as a game board, movement, a point system, and checking when the game is over.

Things I learnt:
- Python Fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Algorithmic Thinking such as developing logic for snake movement, growth, and game over conditions.
- Handling user input.

Possible Improvements:
- Adding a leaderboard.
- Creating better graphics for the snake, game board and food.
- Multiplayer mode.
